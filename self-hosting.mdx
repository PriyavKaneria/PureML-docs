title: Self-host PureML
---

If you`re a large company looking for a proof-of-concept, or an engineer looking to use the open-source version in a funky non-production way, then you're in the right place! Our Docker compose deployment let's you spin up a fresh Pureml instance in minutes.

Want more reliability? The easiest way to get started with PureML is to use [PureML Cloud](https://pureml.com/).

<Info>
  Self-hosted open-source deployment is Apache-2.0 licensed and provided without

## Requirements

- A subsystem with docker-engine installed. [Installation guidelines](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Setting up the compose

1. In a new directory where you want to setup the containers, create a new file `docker-compose.yml`
2. Add the following content from our [official docker-compose example file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PuremlHQ/PureML/main/packages/pureml_docker/docker-compose.yml)

   ```yml
   version: "3"

   services:
     backend:
       image: puremlhq/pureml_backend:local-base
       environment:
         - PURE_SITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
       ports:
         - 8080:8080
       volumes:
         - pureml-data:/pureml_backend/data

     frontend:
       image: puremlhq/pureml_frontend:dev
       environment:
         - NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://backend:8080/api/
       ports:
         - 3000:3000
       links:
         - backend

   volumes:
     pureml-data:
   ```

3. Run the following command to start your containers
   `docker compose up`

   <Note>
     Make sure your docker engine is running for the docker command to work.
   </Note>

4. Additionally, to run the containers in background you can use the command
   `docker compose up -d` or `docker compose up --detach`

If all goes well, You should have a PureML local instance setup and running PureML UI at [localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) with your backend hosted at [localhost:8080/api](http://localhost:8080/api).
You can even checkout the auto generated Open API swagger documentation at [/api/swagger/index.html](http://localhost:8080/api/swagger/index.html)

## Usage

You can use your local self-hosted backend in the sdk by using the `set_backend` function
Example:

<Note>
  Assuming your backend url is [_localhost:8080/api_](http://localhost:8080/api)
</Note>

```python
import pureml

# Call this function near the initialization of your scripts, preferably just after importing
pureml.set_backend("http://localhost:8080/api/") # trainling slash at the end is important

...
```

## Configuration

There are various ways to configure and personalize your PureML instance to better suit your needs. In this section you will find all the information you need about settings and options you can configure to get what you need out of PureML.

### Environment variables

#### Frontend environment

| Variable                | Description                         | Default Value            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL | backend url env to connect frontend | http://backend:8080/api/ |

#### Backend environment

There are multiple environment variables that can be configured externally. But the application also depends upon the configuration of the docker image used to build the compose.

<Warning>
  For backend, **Currently only base image is officially supported**. There will
  be S3, R2, etc. configured images soon which can be used in the compose to
  setup object storage or other settings configuration
</Warning>

For Base Configuration :
_Rows with a missing 'Default Value' usually default to an empty string. This is different from `None`._
| Variable | Description | Default Value |
|--|--|--|
| PORT | port where backend will be deployed | 8080 |
| DATABASE | type of database which will be used. Currently supported sqlite3 & postgres | sqlite3
| DATABASE_URL | url for the database (❗**Required** if database type is postgres) | |
| CGO_ENABLED | whether to use cgo (requires gcc) or pure go | 1 |
| PURE_SITE_BASE_URL | frontend url for email redirections | |
