To get started with PureML, you'll need to install the PureML Python SDK. This SDK will allow you to work with the PureML platform, from creating your account to deploying your models.

To install PureML, simply run the following command:

```bash
pip3 install pureml
```

## New to PureML?

If you're new to PureML, you'll need to sign up for an account before you can start using the platform. CLI supports you to signup. You can do this using the `pureml` command line utility:

```bash
pureml auth signup
```

This command will prompt you to enter your email, user handle, name, and password to create your PureML account. Once you register your details successfully, you will receive a verifycation mail on registered email Id to verify and proceed for login.

## Sign In to start what you left

If you already have a PureML account, you can log in using 3 different ways:
### 1. CLI

The `pureml` command line utility:

```bash
pureml auth login
```

This command will prompt you to PureML UI. Add your sign in credentials and you should see successful login on entering correct credentials.

### 2. SDK

You can sign in to PureML using our Python SDK:

```python
import pureml

pureml.login(org_id='<org_id>', access_token='<access_token>')
```

### 3. PureML UI

For cloud users, go to `https://pureml.com/auth/signin` to sign in through your sign in credentials. For self hosted users, go to `http://localhost:3000/auth/signin`

Once you're logged in, you'll be able to view your datasets, models, and other assets using the PureML platform.
